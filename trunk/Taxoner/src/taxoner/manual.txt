Fast alignment and microorgaism classification .....




Options
-------

	-seq		Input reads (fastq format, single-end) to align against database

	-dbPath		Path to bowtie2 indexes of database
			If -dbNames not specified, then reads will be aligned to all indexes in folder

	-o		Output folder name

	-taxpath	Nodes.dmp file from NCBI database

Optional:

	-host		Align reads against host, and remove host reads

	-p		Number of threads used for analysis
	
	-dbNames	Names of index files to which reads will be aligned 

	-no-host-filter	Do not filter host

	-bt2-maxhits	Max hits searched for each read during alignment (def: 10)

	-bt2-allhits	Get all valid alignments with bowtie2

	-only-neighbor	Do not realign, redo nearest neighbor search for 
			alignment files in the specified output folder

	-neighbor-score	Alignment score at which reads are reduced to 
			nearest neighbor. Value has to be between 0.001 - 1.
			Default: 0.99

example usage:

indexes are in: /home/lorinc/fasta/ folder. This folder only contains bacteria!!! The /home/lorinc/fulldb contains the entire nt database parsed.

The organism specific databases (Bacteria, Viruses, Archaea, Fungi) have to be created)

./a.out -dbPath /home/lorinc/fasta/ -taxpath /home/lorinc/annotation/nodes.dmp -seq /home/lorinc/reads/ill.fastq -p 6 -o resFull/
